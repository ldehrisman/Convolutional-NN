# Convolutional-NN

This repository is for Project 3 for Machine Learning for Team 15. 

OBJECTIVE 
Demonstrate ability to apply CNN in Python with PyTorch. 

DESCRIPTION
The University of Arkansas has found several venders on Etsy using the
officially licensed Razorback logo without permission or a licensed agreement. Therefore,
they hired your team to create an image classification model to classify if the images
contain the official licensed logo or not. This will help them identify venders to investigate
in the future to prevent revenue loss.

CODE SCRIPT:
- MAIN: Group_15_Project_3.ipynb

FOLDERS:
- data: stores our found pictures of Arkansas and Non-Arkansas logo containing images for the CNN model
- model: stores the final CNN model, Group_15_FullModel.ph
